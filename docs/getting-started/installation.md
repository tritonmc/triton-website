# Installation

## Downloading the plugin and dependencies

To get started, you first need to download the plugin.  
Triton is available to download from
[SpigotMC](https://triton.rexcantor64.com/spigot) or
[Polymart](https://triton.rexcantor64.com/polymart).

Additionally, you might need to download some dependencies if you don't have them already:

- [ProtocolLib 4.5.0+](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/)
- [_(Optional)_ PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/)

Once you've downloaded the plugin, place the `.jar` in the `plugins` folder of all your servers (Spigot, BungeeCord, etc).

::: warning
Using any other server software than Spigot or BungeeCord (e.g. Paper, Waterfall, etc) is not officially supported.  
However, since a large number of users are using those, bug fixes will be provided,
even though internal testing is only done on vanilla Spigot/BungeeCord.

Using the Velocity proxy is _partially_ supported. Check out the [Velocity guide](/guides/velocity.md) for more information.

## Generate default files

Finally, start all your servers and let Triton generate the default files.
Proceed to the [initial configuration](./initial-configuration.md) guide.
