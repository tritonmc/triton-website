# Installation

If you want to get access to Triton v3,
make sure you've [enrolled in the beta program](./beta-enrollment.md) before proceeding.

## Downloading the plugin and dependencies

To get started with the plugin, you first need to download the plugin.  
For beta versions, the plugin will be hosted on [Polymart](https://triton.rexcantor64.com/polymart).  
Otherwise, download the plugin from your marketplace of choice.

Additionally, you might need to download some dependencies if you don't have them already:

- [ProtocolLib 4.5.0+](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/)
- [_(Optional)_ PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/)

Once you've downloaded the plugin, unzip the file.

::: warning
Using any other server software than Spigot or BungeeCord (e.g. Paper, Waterfall, etc) is not officially supported.  
However, since a large number of users are using those, bug fixes will be provided, even though internal testing is done on vanilla Spigot/BungeeCord.

## Generate default files

Finally, start all your servers and let Triton generate the default files.
Proceed to the [initial configuration](./initial-configuration.md) guide.
