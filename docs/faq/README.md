# FAQ

## I cannot translate item names and lores on inventory

By default, the `allow-in-inventory` option in Triton's config is disabled.  
This is because items might permanently change their name if the player is in creative mode.
If the player's cannot drop their items or they're always in survival/adventure mode, this is safe to enable.  
Otherwise, translating item names and lores will only work on GUIs.

To fix this, enable `allow-in-inventory` on config.

## I cannot use placeholders on scoreboards

Translating scoreboards requires using [PlaceholderAPI](../concepts/placeholderapi.md) instead of Triton's
`[lang]` placeholders.  
This is due to technical limitations.

Since version **3.7.0** you can use PlaceholderAPI placeholders inside translations, which
aliviates the limitation of not being able to use variables when translating with PlaceholderAPI.

## Is there a placeholder to get the player's current language?

No, Triton does not provide any placeholders by default.
However, it is easy to add this functionality by taking advantage of the
[PlaceholderAPI Integration](../concepts/placeholderapi.md).

Simply create a new translation with the desired key (for example, `lang`) and then
set the text in each language to the name of the language itself (for example, set the
English translation to `English`, the Portuguese translation to `Portuguese`, etc.).
Finally, you can use the PAPI `%triton_lang%` placeholder to get the player's language.
