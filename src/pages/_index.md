# Why Triton?

Do you own an international Minecraft server?
Would you like to send each player, messages in their own language?
Well, look no further!
Triton offers this among a whole host of other awesome features!
This plugin uses a placeholder which will be replaced (dynamically, per player) with a message defined in a language file.

Triton works with any plugin that allows customization of messages.
